# Bad Bank Project
This project is my capstone assignment for my MIT Professional Certificate in Coding program. This project includes a a front-end, back-end and a database. Bad Bank was a project that was given to us earlier in the course, where no information was safe. All user data was exposed and viewable to anyone with the link. My task was to secure the bad bank with authentication and authorization privilages. I did this using Firebase. This project helped build an understanding of the three tiers of an application as I begin my journey into the coding profession!
